        // Collections Framework
        // A collection framework represents a group of object. Java collections provide
        // classes and interfaces for us to be able to write code quickly and
        // efficiently.

        // Why do we need collections
        /*
         * We need collections for efficient storage and better manipulation of data in
         * Java.
         * E.g.1. resize the array?
         * 2.Insert an element in between?
         * Delete an element from an array?
         * We can do such things using collections...
         */

        // How are collections available?
        // Collections in Java are available as classes and interfaces. Following are
        // few commonly used collections in Java
        /*
         * ArrayList
         * Set
         * Stack
         * HashMap
         */

        // Collection in java is available in java.util package. Collection class also
        // provides statis methods for sorting,searching,etc.
